## 3. Design Details
### 3.1 Main Design Features
#### Real-Time Interaction
- Implement real-time physics simulation algorithms to enable users to interact with components dynamically. This includes features like dragging, rotating, stacking, and applying forces to objects, Gravity enable or disable within the environment.
- Utilize efficient collision detection and response mechanisms to ensure that interactions between components are realistic and responsive to user input.
#### Educational Resources
- Integrate educational resources directly into the simulation environment, such as interactive tutorials, tooltips, and contextual help, to guide users in understanding physics concepts and simulation techniques.
- Provide visualizations and explanations of physical phenomena within the simulation, helping users bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application.

#### Feedback and Visualization:
- Provide immediate visual feedback to users when interacting with components, such as highlighting selected objects, displaying manipulation handles, or visualizing physics effects like collisions and friction.
- Incorporate audio feedback, such as collision sounds or object manipulation sounds, to enhance the immersive experience and provide additional cues to users.

### 3.2 User Interface
- The UI layer should be developed using a suitable technology stack for rendering 3D graphics, such as Unity3D, Unreal Engine, or WebGL.
- It should provide intuitive controls for users to manipulate and interact with components, such as dragging, rotating, and resizing.
- Consider implementing features like snapping to grid or alignment guides to assist users in assembling components accurately.
- Include UI elements for accessing the component library, simulation controls, and project management functionalities.

### 3.3 Error Handling
- Design comprehensive error handling mechanisms throughout the application to detect, report, and recover from errors effectively.
- Utilize structured logging to record detailed information about errors, including stack traces, error codes, and contextual data, facilitating troubleshooting and debugging.
- Implement user-friendly error messages and notifications to provide clear guidance to users in case of errors or unexpected behaviors.
- Establish error monitoring and alerting systems to notify administrators of critical errors or anomalies in real-time, enabling timely response and resolution.

### 3.4 Performance
- The project aims to have minimal hit on the performance of the actual software itself. This is important as the objective of analysis will be defeated if the software run time details are malformed. The frontend application must have acceptably fast load times for visual information. The API performance must not act as a bottleneck for the application as this can hinder the data collection process. Good internet connectivity is considered a prerequisite for the application to function as intended. The database must have usable read and write times.

### 3.5 Security
- Encryption for data transmission and storage to ensure the privacy and integrity of user data.
- Role-based access control to manage user permissions and restrict access to sensitive features or data.
- Regular security audits and updates to patch vulnerabilities and ensure compliance with security standards.

### 3.6 Reliability
- Prioritize robustness and stability in the system architecture to deliver a reliable simulation experience to users.
- Conduct thorough testing, including stress testing and edge case scenarios, to identify and address potential failure points and performance bottlenecks.
- Implement error handling and recovery mechanisms to gracefully handle unexpected events, such as simulation errors, network disruptions, or hardware failures.
- Monitor system metrics and logs to proactively identify reliability issues and implement measures for fault tolerance and resilience, such as redundant servers or automatic failover mechanisms.

### 3.7 Maintainability
- Emphasize clean code practices, modular architecture, and well-defined interfaces to facilitate ease of maintenance and future enhancements.
- Adopt design patterns such as MVC (Model-View-Controller) or MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) to separate concerns and improve code maintainability.
- Establish coding standards, documentation conventions, and version control best practices to ensure consistency and clarity in the codebase.
- Implement automated testing, continuous integration, and deployment pipelines to streamline the development process and catch issues early, reducing maintenance overhead.

### 3.8 Portability
- Ensure that SimuWare is designed to be platform-agnostic, allowing it to run seamlessly on different operating systems and devices.
- Utilize cross-platform development frameworks and technologies such as Unity3D or web-based solutions compatible with modern browsers.
- Minimize dependencies on platform-specific features or libraries, favoring standardized APIs and technologies to maximize portability.
- Provide options for deployment in various environments, including desktop applications, web applications, and mobile applications, catering to different user preferences and device capabilities.

### 3.9 Reusability
- To enhance reusability, the architecture should support modular design principles. Components and modules should be designed to be easily reusable in different simulation scenarios.
- Implement a component-based architecture where individual components can be instantiated, configured, and reused across multiple projects.
- Provide a library of reusable simulation assets, such as pre-built structures, materials, and mechanisms, that users can easily incorporate into their simulations.
- Encourage community contribution by allowing users to share their custom components and simulations with others, fostering a collaborative ecosystem of reusable resources.
